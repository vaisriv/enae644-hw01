NOTE that the IDs here refer to the positions of nodes in the files assuming 1-based indexing (and C++ code assumes 0-based indexing) so if you use the C++ code that I have provided (or other 0-based indexing code that you have written yourself), then you will need to subtract 1 from the values in this file when you set start and goal IDs in your code. In other words node ID 1 in this file refers to the first node in the file, which will be stored as node 0 in the C++ code.

Problem 1:
node file: nodes_1.txt
edge file: edges_with_costs_1.txt
start node ID: 7
goal node ID: 8


Problem 2:
node file: nodes_2.txt
edge file: edges_with_costs_2.txt
start node ID: 17
goal node ID: 16


Problem 3:
node file: nodes_3.txt
edge file: edges_with_costs_3.txt
start node ID: 1
goal node ID: 2


Problem 4:
node file: nodes_4.txt
edge file: edges_with_costs_4.txt
start node ID: 636
goal node ID: 799


Problem 5:
node file: nodes_5.txt
edge file: edges_with_costs_5.txt
start node ID: 321
goal node ID: 532
